  - Surfing is a mechanic that comes from CSGO, it works by pushing yourself into
    a wall, and the force sticks you to the wall and propels you forward
  - 'To surf, simply jump into a wall, and hold either A or D. If you are on the
    right side of the wall, hold A. If you are on the left side, hold D. '
  - Depending on where your mouse is pointing, you will "surf" up and down the ramp
