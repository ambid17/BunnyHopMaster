  - This level is to teach you the fundamentals of bunny hopping. This mechanic came
    from a bug in Quake. The mechanic was put into the Source Engine, the engine
    that powers Counter Strike, which is the inspiration.
  - To Start, run forward, and hold SPACE to continuously jump. You can let go of
    W, and keep your momentum.
  - Now, start turning and looking around. Notice this doesn't impact your momentum
  - To gain speed (while still jumping) look to the left and hold A. This will multiply
    your initial velocity with the new input. Depending on how fast you turn in between
    frames, you will gain speed. Look too fast and the velocities will counteract,
    look too slow and you won't gain much speed.
  - Now, try the same thing while looking to the right and hold D. See how fast you
    can get going using the UI in the top left.
  - You can switch directions in air, and even bunny hop backwards. Spend some time
    getting used to this as it is the fundamental skill of this game.
